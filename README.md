# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to provide UFO enthusiasts with a dedicated website to easily research UFO sightings by date, city, state, country and/or shape of the ufo.

## Results  
A user can easily search UFO sightings by multiple criteria. By coming to our website and scrolling down, the user will find a data table that displays a list of reported UFO sightings. 
If a user wants to see the sightings on January 8th, 2010 in Texas they would enter that date in the first filter box and enter "tx" in the state filter. The data table will then be updated with the UFO sightings that fit those criteria:

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that as more articles are added then the data table will be pushed down the page.
I recommend two design changes for further development. The first is to make the data table the first element on the page with an anchor link to articles further down the page. The next change would be to add a "Clear all" button so that a user could easily clear their previous filter entries.
